## 👥 What is this project?
This project is a Node.js application that automates following and unfollowing users on GitHub at random intervals, simulating human-like behavior. It uses a queue system to manage actions, integrates logging for tracking activity, ensures compliance with GitHub’s API rate limits, and helps boost your profile growth, presence, and interactions by automatically engaging with users. Designed for long-term, 24/7 operation, it efficiently handles large volumes of users by optimizing API calls and minimizing redundant actions, ensuring smooth and resource-effective performance.
